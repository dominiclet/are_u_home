# Are you home?

## Introduction

Telegram bot written in Rust to send updates on whether members of a Telegram group are home. 
After a "going home" session is started, the bot will send messages to the group in regular intervals until all members update that they are home. 

## Running the bot

The `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable must be set. Retrieve this token from the Botfather telegram bot.
